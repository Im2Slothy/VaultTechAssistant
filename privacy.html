        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>For Vault-Tec Assistant Discord Bot</p>
    </header>

    <main class="legal-content">
        <p><strong>Last Updated: November 4, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Vault-Tec Assistant ("Bot," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you interact with the Bot on Discord. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use the Bot, we collect and store the following types of information necessary for its features to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord User Information:</strong> Your unique Discord User ID is the primary key for all your data. We also store your public Discord username/display name for features like leaderboards and personalized messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Game Data:</strong> This includes your bottlecap balance, health, radiation level, inventory (item IDs, quantities), equipped power armor, weapons, and minigame statistics (wins, losses, best times).</li>
            <li><strong>Pet Data:</strong> We store your equipped pet's ID and its given name.</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement Data:</strong> If you are a settlement mayor, we store your settlement's name, tag, resources, building levels, and activity logs. If you are a member, we store which settlement you belong to.</li>
            <li><strong>Player Vending Data:</strong> We store the items you list for sale in your vending machine, including item ID, quantity, and price.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooldown Timestamps:</strong> We store timestamps for time-gated activities like `/daily` and `/scavenge` to manage cooldowns.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Effects & Attributes:</strong> We store data on active effects from items (like Jet or Rad-X) and their expiration times.</li>
            <li><strong>Expedition Data:</strong> For the expedition feature, we store the start time, end time, total duration, and a log of events that occurred during your dweller's journey.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> We store your preference for profile visibility (public or private) as set by the `/profile_privacy` command.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Usage and Logs:</strong> We log command usage for analytics and troubleshooting. Successful trade transactions made with the `/trade` command are logged in a private channel in the official support server for security and dispute resolution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is stored in a local SQLite database file (`fallout_data.db`) on the server where the Bot is hosted. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any other personally identifiable information.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Bot's features and functionality.</li>
            <li>Save your progress in games and manage your in-game economy (bottlecaps, inventory, expeditions, settlements).</li>
            <li>Enforce game cooldowns and manage temporary status effects.</li>
            <li>Control the visibility of your profile to other users based on your privacy setting.</li>
            <li>Display public leaderboards (for players and settlements) and player-run vending machines.</li>
            <li>Personalize your experience (e.g., showing your pet on your profile) and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All user-specific data is stored in a local SQLite database file on the server where the Bot is hosted. We take reasonable measures to protect this data, but no system is 100% secure. Do not share sensitive personal information with the Bot.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Visibility</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. Your data is used solely for the operation of the Bot. However, certain data is made visible to other users as part of the Bot's features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Discord username and game scores are visible on public leaderboards.</li>
            <li>Your settlement's name, tag, and stats are visible on the settlement leaderboard.</li>
            <li>Your player-run vending machine listings are visible to anyone who uses the `/browse_shops` or `/vending view` commands.</li>
            <li>If you set your profile to public using `/profile_privacy`, other users will be able to view your stats, equipped gear, pet, and settlement affiliation using the `/view_profile` command. By default, profiles are private.</li>
            <li>Trade transactions made using `/trade` are posted in a private log channel in the support server. These logs include the Discord usernames of the trading parties and the contents of the trade.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. User Rights and Data Retention</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data associated with the Bot. To do so, please contact the Bot developer(s) through the official support server. Upon request, we will make reasonable efforts to delete your data from our active database, unless retention is required for legitimate operational purposes (e.g., preventing abuse).</p>
        <p>We retain your data as long as you continue to use the Bot or until you request its deletion. Data for inactive users may be periodically pruned.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that a child under this age has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes where feasible (e.g., via a support server announcement or bot update message). Your continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us through the official support server for the Vault-Tec Assistant (link available on the Bot's main webpage or via a help command).</p>
