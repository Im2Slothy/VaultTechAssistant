        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By inviting and using the Vault-Tec Assistant Discord Bot ("Bot") in your Discord server, or by interacting with the Bot in any server, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Bot.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Bot provides Fallout-themed entertainment and utility features for Discord servers. These features include, but are not limited to: a persistent player-based economy with items and bottlecaps; interactive minigames (terminal hacking, lockpicking, gambling); a crafting, selling, and player-vending system; player-to-player item trading; a long-term expedition system; a player-run settlement management system; PVE encounters and boss battles; and 24/7 playback of simulated Fallout-themed radio stations. Features may be added, modified, or removed at the discretion of the Bot developer(s).</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Bot to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violate any applicable laws or Discord's Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>Engage in any activity that is harmful, abusive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li>Attempt to exploit, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to the Bot or its underlying systems.</li>
            <li>Distribute spam or unsolicited messages through the Bot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to restrict or terminate access to the Bot for users or servers that violate these terms.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Bot's original code, design, and textual content are the property of its developer(s) (Im2Slothy). Fallout®, Vault-Tec®, Pip-Boy®, and all related names, logos, and imagery are trademarks or registered trademarks of ZeniMax Media Inc. or its affiliates. This Bot is a fan-made project and is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Bethesda Softworks LLC or ZeniMax Media Inc.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Bot will always be available, error-free, or secure.</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer(s) of the Bot shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Bot; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein.</p>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Bot at any time, with or without cause or notice, for any reason, including but not limited to, a breach of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes, where feasible (e.g., via a support server announcement or bot update message). Your continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us through the official support server for the Vault-Tec Assistant (link available on the Bot's main webpage or via a help command).</p>
